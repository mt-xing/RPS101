# RPS101
<p>A very poorly coded version of Rock Paper Scissors 101 in Java for AP Computer Science.</p>
<p>Completely console based and requires an uncensored internet connection (will not work at school if running from BlueJay).</p>
<p>Please don't just copy and paste the whole thing into your own project. That defeats the purpose.</p>
